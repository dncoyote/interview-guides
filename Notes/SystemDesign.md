# **System Design**

## **E-commerce application**
#### Search Service
- Use ElasticSearch for fast and efficient search functionality.
- Implement caching using Redis or Memcached to store frequently accessed search results and reduce search latency.
- Use a NoSQL database like MongoDB for storing product metadata and attributes.

#### Cart Service
- Utilize MySQL database to manage cart items for each user.
- Implement RESTful APIs for adding/removing items from the cart, updating quantities, and fetching cart details.
- Use Redis for caching frequently accessed cart data to improve response times.

#### Place Order Service
- Use MySQL database to store order information such as user details, products, quantities, and order status.
- Implement RESTful APIs for placing orders, updating order status, and retrieving order history.
- Integrate with the Notification Service to send email notifications for order confirmation, shipment updates, and delivery status.

#### Assign Delivery Partner Service
- Use MySQL database to store delivery partner details such as name, contact information, availability, and service areas.
- Implement APIs for assigning delivery partners to orders based on location, availability, and order size.
- Ensure synchronization with the Place Order Service to update order status and notify users about assigned delivery partners.

#### Notification Service
- Implement an email notification service using SMTP or a third-party email service provider (e.g., SendGrid, Amazon SES).
- Create templates for different notification types (order confirmation, shipment updates, delivery status) and dynamically populate user-specific details.
- Integrate with other services (Place Order, Assign Delivery Partner) to trigger email notifications based on specific events and status changes.

#### Synchronous Communication
- Use REST templates for synchronous communication between microservices within the application.
- Implement Feign clients for declarative RESTful API calls, simplifying service-to-service communication and reducing boilerplate code.

#### Asynchronous Communication (Kafka)
- Integrate Apache Kafka for asynchronous communication between components, enabling real-time event processing and data streaming.
- Use Kafka topics for publishing and subscribing to events such as order placement, status updates, and notification triggers.
- Implement Kafka consumers to process messages asynchronously and update database states or trigger actions accordingly.

#### Rate Limiter
- Implement a rate-limiting mechanism to prevent spam hits and control the number of requests allowed per user or IP address.
- Use algorithms like Token Bucket or Leaky Bucket to manage request rates and enforce rate limits at the API gateway or service level.
- Monitor and log rate-limited requests to analyze traffic patterns and adjust rate-limiting configurations as needed.

#### Other Required Components
- API Gateway: Use an API gateway (e.g., Netflix Zuul, Kong) to manage incoming requests, enforce security policies, and route traffic to appropriate microservices.
- Authentication & Authorization: Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user authentication and authorization, ensuring secure access to protected resources.
- Load Balancing: Use a load balancer (e.g., Nginx, HAProxy) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of microservices for scalability and high availability.
- Monitoring & Logging: Implement logging mechanisms (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) and monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) to track system performance, detect errors, and troubleshoot issues proactively.

#### Interconnections
- Users interact with the frontend UI, which sends requests to the API Gateway.
- The API Gateway routes requests to appropriate microservices (Search, Cart, Place Order, Assign Delivery Partner).
- Microservices communicate synchronously using REST templates and Feign clients for real-time interactions (e.g., adding items to cart, placing orders).
- Asynchronous events (e.g., order placement, status updates) are published to Kafka topics for processing.
- The Notification Service subscribes to relevant Kafka topics to trigger email notifications based on events and status changes.
- Rate limiting is enforced at the API Gateway to prevent spam hits and manage request rates per user/IP address.
